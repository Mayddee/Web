    <h1>Black Of My Eye</h1>
    <p>Black of my eye<br> 
       Frame of my mind <br>
       Drink never dry <br>
       Love of my Life<br>
       Parting is winter, your absence is sorrow <br>
       I wish to stay until the morrow<br> 
       Between your fair arms <br>
       when the nightingale sings, 'Terrow'<br> 
       The corners of your eyes <br>
       sparkle and they glisten <br>
       when you speak your solid words <br>
       everyone will listen <br>
       Black of my eye <br>
       Frame of my mind <br>
       Drink never dry <br>
       Love of my Life<br>
    </p>
